echo "Once upon a time there was a $NOUN1. He dreamed of going to $NOUN2 but he was too $ADJECTIVE1 to go. For his fifth birthday, his mom told him 
 he gets to go to $NOUN2. He $VERB1 in celebration. On the day he was supposed to go to $NOUN2 it was $NOUN3 so his mom said he couldn't go. He 
was devasted. He cried for $NOUN4 days straight. Since he was so sad, his mom gave him $NOUN5. That made him happy temporarily, but he still really 
 wanted to go to $NOUN2. He was so mad at his mom for not taking him to $NOUN2 that he gave her the silent treatment. Nothing would make him happy
besides going to $NOUN2. Weeks later, he met a $NOUN6. $NOUN6  and him ran away and finally went to $NOUN2 and he was finally happy again. 
The end."
